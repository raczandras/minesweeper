A simple minesweeper game for my Software Engineering class.



Created on Linux, using Java 11.


Run with the following commands, from the project's root directory:

* mvn package

* java -jar ./target/minesweeper-1.0.jar


You will need to either configure the resources/META-INF/persistence.xml file to use your database,
or ask permission from me to use mine.
