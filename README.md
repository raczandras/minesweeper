A simple minesweeper game for my Software Engineering class.

&nbsp;

Created on Linux, using Java 11.

&nbsp;

Run with the following commands, from the project's root directory:

* mvn package

* java -jar ./target/minesweeper-1.0.jar

&nbsp;

You will either need to configure the resources/META-INF/persistence.xml file to use your database,
or ask permission from me to use mine.
